# HumanPace.me
Hello Everyone,

Before you get started with this crazy adventure I want to thank you for visiting. This blog series and experience are to help individuals such as yourself become better; but at a Human Pace. This may come off as a lazy person's method of improvement but that couldn't be further from the truth. The purpose of this experience is to show that success in personal improvement comes from a plan, reasonable "human" means, and always realizing that there is an area of improvement. Now we are not the paople we were yesterday and because of that we can always make the decision to try and "do better." From nutrition to fad diets to workout regimes to product reviews to raw, real-life personal stories that have helped me along the journey, I hope the experience is bneficial to everyone. Let's start improving and continue to always try and do something better, let's live together, let's succeed together. We are ever evolving and the limits are very rarely reached, often abandoned, and underestimated in most everyone. From one excited human to another.

All the Best,

Tory
